Hi! I'm Hanna Palya, a PhD student in mathematical epidemiology at the [Institute for Global Pandemic Planning, University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/igpp/). My supervisors are [blah] and [blah].

My current research focus is on improving early detection of pandemics. I'm working on improving syndromic surveillance by developing novel clustering algorithms for syndromic data. You can read more about my work here, or get in touch via email to talk about it.

Previously, I [wrote a paper advocating for DNA synthesis screening](https://www.sciencepolicyjournal.org/uploads/5/4/3/4/5434385/p%C3%A1lya_delaney_jspg_21-3.pdf), managed a cohort of summer research fellows, and studied biology and philosophy at the University of St Andrews.
